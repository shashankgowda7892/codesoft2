                value is calculated after any trade-in credit or eligible discount applied. Any subsequent order
                adjustment(s) or cancellation(s) may result in instant savings being recalculated, and any refund may be
                adjusted to account for instant savings clawback; this may result in no refund being made to you. Offer

                be combined with Apple Store for Education or Corporate Employee Purchase Plan pricing. Multiple

                will be provided by your bank, subject to your bank’s terms and conditions. Minimum order spend applies
                as per your card-issuing bank threshold. Offer cannot be combined with Apple Store for Education or
